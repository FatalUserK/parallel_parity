These are just features that have crossed my mind which I would like to at least consider implementing later down the line.
These are just bonus features that I may or may not get around to, we'll see

- Option to modulate pixel scenes into Sky/Hell loops
  - should in theory be trivial?
  - but its a whole new string of logic i need to cram into all 3 stages of pixel scene handling :(
- Option to make default handling for unknown pixel scenes to be true
  - add blacklist for mods, though reasonably this should be noted as a potentially buggy setting with other mods involved, so support is optional
- Shadow Kolmi for if Kolmi is enabled in PWs
  - has a purple shadowy/glitchy sampo which when you interact with it, it disappears and the fight starts (no sampo farming for you!!)
    - shadowy/glitchy like the purple tapes from FNaF: Help Wanted
- other shadow bosses??
- add Cauldron and Eyes
